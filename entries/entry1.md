# <center>Entry 1: Introduction</center>

<p>Hi! I am currently a senior in High School and for my 
final Software Engineering project, I will be embarking on a 9 
week long journey into the world of independent study. </p>
</p>

### <strong>Choosing a Topic</strong>

<p>So after days of Googling, searching through articles, 
Googling, browsing through Codecademy lessons, Googling, and… 
did I mention Googling? Well, after searching through many possible 
areas of study, I narrowed down my choices to SASS, CyberSecurity, or
ReactJS. Ultimately, I decided to choose React JS, as the topic would 
be challenging enough to push me out of my comfort zone to learn valuable 
skills, but not so challenging that I would enter, what my class refers to 
as, <em> The Panic Zone</em>. I had learned a little bit of Javascript 
previously in my class, so I thought that that background knowledge would be 
helpful when diving deeper into React Javascript. Overall, I felt 
learning React JS would not only be an interesting skill to learn and a 
useful tool in creating projects, but also a marketable skill that could 
be utilized in future career endeavors. </p>

### <strong>What is React JS?</strong>

<p>React JS is a JavaScript library, developed by the creators of Facebook, 
that is used for building user interfaces.The great aspect of React is that 
it efficiently updates and renders whenever your data changes. Moreover, to 
render means to simply display it on the view. When I first saw an example of React JS code, 
I was suprised to find code such as 

    <h1>Hello</h1> 
    
since it looked as though it was HTML, but I learned that it was, in fact, JSX, an optional syntax for Javascript.
I found that it was much easier to code and understand using this
syntax, as it utilizes aspects of HTML, which is a language I was 
pretty familiar with. 
 </p>
 
### <strong>Hello World!</strong>
<p>
To begin my journey into the world of React JS, I read many articles in order to find out,
not only how to code in React JS, but why it is useful or the purpose of using the language.
I found many articles that praised it's flexibility and efficiency. I also found out that popular sites, 
such as the New York Times, KhanAcademy, and Instagram use React JS, which was really interesting. 
After browsing through various articles, I decided to begin coding examples with React JS. 
I had taken Codecademy lessons in the past, when working with languages such as Ruby or Javascript, so I searched online to see if the website had 
lessons on React JS and was pleasantly surprised to find that they did. Through taking these lessons, I 
came across this line of code:

    ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello world</h1>,document.getElementById('app'))
    
I learned that, not only does ReactDOM.render utilize parenthesis, but when writing multi 
line code in React, you must use parenthesis around the expression. 
Moreover, when trying to understand this line of code, I decided to break it down. 
First, I learned that 

    ReactDOM.render() 
is a way of displaying or outputting code in React. I was confused at 
first by the purpose of ReactDOM, but after searching through many articles, 
I came to realize that it serves as a package of sorts that contains a set 
of useful methods and that it is mainly used for web apps. I knew 

    <h1>Hello world</h1>
from my previous experience with HTML, and began to understand that the
second argument would find a specific element labeled with an id of ‘app’ 
and would place the first argument of the h1 inside the element. So, I 
suppose that in your html you can have, for instance, a div with the id of
“bananas” and this line of code finds that div within the html, based on the 
id, and renders or displays “Hello world” inside of that div, the result being:
	
	Hello world

In other words, the first argument is <em><b>what</b></em> is displayed and the second
argument designates <em><b>where</b></em> it is displayed

After taking some lessons on CodeAcademy, I was curious to find out what I could create later on 
using React JS. One example I came across was the creation of an online ToDo List using React JS:
https://www.kirupa.com/react/simple_todo_app_react.htm
I also found a cool example that changes inputted text into a formatted website:
https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby

### <strong>Takeaways</strong>
<ul>
    <li>In order to start learning a new language or topic, I find that it is helpful to, in a sense, “dip your toes in the water” and <b>try an example on your own</b>, even if it is simply getting “Hello World!” to display on the screen</li>
    <li>When attempting to make sense of complex code, try <b>breaking it down</b> and <b>putting the code into your own words</b> to understand the function or purpose of each part</li>
    <li><b>Read</b> as many articles as you can. Not only search for the <b>how</b>, but also for the <b>why</b></li>
    <li><b>Google</b> is your friend. </li>
    <li>Try to <b>find examples of projects</b> that make use of the topic you are learning in order to gain perspective on the possibilities of what can be done or to become inspired to create your own project in the future</li>
</ul>
