<p>In order to grow my knowledge of <b>React JS</b>, 
I continued to take courses on <em>CodeAcademy</em>. The practice examples, important lessons,
and quizzes provided by <em>CodeAcademy</em> were extremely helpful in the process of learning and becoming more comfortable with the language. </p>
<p>When I began my second week on indpendent study, I was only scratching the surface of what <b>React JS</b> can really do. 
This week was dedicated to growing my knowledge of the basics, as well as, discovering some projects that could be 
developed utilizing <b>React JS</b>.</p>
