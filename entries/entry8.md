# <center>Entry 8: Curtain Call </center>

<p>My independent study is coming to an end. 
During my second to last week of my independent study into react js, 
I continued to work on my final project. As a result of my difficulties with 
coding react js in c9, I decided to code in jsfiddle and codepen instead. I had 
to adapt in order to meet the deadlines and adaptability is one important skill 
that I have learned through the course of these 8 weeks. </p>

<p>Since I decided to code my final project on codepen, I decided to transfer
and tinker with the code in my Book-o-mmender project that had existed on c9.
I only needed some of the css and html from my Book-o-mmender project in order 
to add react js components. My react js project will not include the complete 
functionality of Book-o-mmender, but it will still have the look of the
web app. </p>

<p>In order to address one of the goals on my to do list, 
I searched online and came across an example of a button creation on jsfiddle. 
I tinkered with the code so that it would match what I needed for my own project. 
I was able to get an alert message to pop up when the button was 
clicked, utilizing event handlers in react js.  However, the example 
I had looked at included a link to an external js page. Next week, I will
have to fix some bugs and figure out how to transfer the code created on 
jsfiddle to the Book-o-mmender code on codepen. I created a button through 
react js that, when clicked, alerts the user that the book has been added 
to their book-o-bag. </p>

<p>I also found an icon of a book bag that could be used for 
the website. For now, because the functionality will not be complete yet, 
when the backpack icon is clicked, the user will be alerted that there are 
currently no books in their Book-o-Bag yet. </p>

### Takeaways
<ul>
    <li><b>Adaptability is key</b>. Sometimes you just have to roll 
    with the punches, so to speak, and adjust your plans in order to 
    achieve a goal</li>

    <li><b>Use your resources</b> My favorite is Google. I found it
    helpful to look through articles targeted towards certain concepts 
    I wanted to utilize in my own project. However, sometimes you have 
    to do a lot of digging to find what is helpful to you or what you are 
    really looking for. </li>
