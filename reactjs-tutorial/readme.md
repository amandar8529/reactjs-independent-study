### What is React JS?
<ul>
    <li>a javascript library that is mainly used for the front end or view of a webpage or web app</li>
    <li>allows for the creation of reusable UI (User Interface) components</li>
</ul>

### Components
<ul>
    <li><b>everything</b> in React JS is a component</li>
    <li>data is passed between components through the use of props</li>
    <li>the data flow between components is one directional because 
    the main component keeps track of everything inside of it</li>
</li>
</ul>

### JSX
<ul>
    <li>syntax that can be used by React</li>
    <li>looks very similar to HTML</li>
    <li>easier to code and is more understandable than regular javascript syntax</li>
</ul>


### What can React JS do?
<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>

### Why React JS?
<ul>
    <li>manages and automatically updates the DOM for you (Document Object Model: allows programs and scripts to access and update a document)</li>
    <li>Unlike regular Javascript, React JS can utilize JSX, a syntax that looks very similar to HTML, thus making React an easier language to code or understand</li>
    <li>Other languages have interactions between the model, view, and controller. React JS only works with the view and is entirely made of components that interact with each other. The main component keeps track of its sub components 
    and if anything changes, it efficiently <b>reacts</b> to those changes</li>
</ul>
